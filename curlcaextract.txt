   The Mozilla CA certificate
   store in PEM format (around
   250KB uncompressed):

   cacert.pem

   This bundle was generated at
   Wed Dec 5 04:12:10 2018 GMT .

   This PEM file contains the
   datestamp of the conversion and
   we only make a new conversion
   if there's a change in either
   the script or the source file.
   This service checks for updates
   every day. Here's the sha256sum
   of the current PEM file.

Missing Name Constraints

   The converted PEM file only
   contains the digital signatures
   for CAs. Several of those CAs
   have constraints in Firefox
   (and other browsers) to only be
   allowed for certain domains and
   other similar additional
   conditions. Those constraints
   are thus not brought along in
   this cacert file!

CA certificate store license

   The PEM file is only a
   converted version of the
   original one and thus it is
   licensed under the same license
   as the Mozilla source file: MPL
   2.0

Automated downloads from here

   We don't mind you downloading
   the PEM file from us in an
   automated fashion, but please
   don't do it more often than
   once per day. It is only
   updated once every few months
   anyway.

   A suitable curl command line to
   only download it when it has
   changed:
  curl --remote-name --time-cond cacert.
pem https://curl.haxx.se/ca/cacert.pem

The conversion script mk-ca-bundle

   The mk-ca-bundle tool converts
   Mozilla's certificate store to
   PEM format, suitable for
   (lib)curl and others.

Convert from your local Firefox
installation

   You can also extract the ca
   certs off your Firefox
   installation, if you just have
   the 'certutil' tool installed
   and run the firefox-db2pem.sh
   script!
