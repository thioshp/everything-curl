   cURL is a software package
   which consists of command line
   tool and a library for
   transferring data using URL
   syntax.

   cURL supports various protocols
   like, DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS,
   Gopher, HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP,
   IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3,
   POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP, SFTP,
   SMTP, SMTPS, Telnet and TFTP.

   This article provides 15
   practical cURL usage examples.

1. Download a Single File

   The following command will get
   the content of the URL and
   display it in the STDOUT (i.e
   on your terminal).
$ curl http://www.centos.org

   To store the output in a file,
   you an redirect it as shown
   below. This will also display
   some additional download
   statistics.
$ curl http://www.centos.org > centos-or
g.html
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average
 Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload
Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 27329    0 27329    0     0   104k
    0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  167k

2. Save the cURL Output to a file

   We can save the result of the
   curl command to a file by using
   -o/-O options.
     * -o (lowercase o) the result
       will be saved in the
       filename provided in the
       command line
     * -O (uppercase O) the
       filename in the URL will be
       taken and it will be used
       as the filename to store
       the result

$ curl -o mygettext.html http://www.gnu.
org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

   Now the page gettext.html will
   be saved in the file named
   ‘mygettext.html’. You can also
   note that when running curl
   with -o option, it displays the
   progress meter for the download
   as follows.

   [INS: :INS]

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average
 Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload
Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
 66 1215k   66  805k    0     0  33060
    0  0:00:37  0:00:24  0:00:13 45900
100 1215k  100 1215k    0     0  39474
    0  0:00:31  0:00:31 --:--:-- 68987

   When you use curl -O (uppercase
   O), it will save the content in
   the file named ‘gettext.html’
   itself in the local machine.
$ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/ge
ttext/manual/gettext.html

   Note: When curl has to write
   the data to the terminal, it
   disables the Progress Meter, to
   avoid confusion in printing. We
   can use ‘>’|’-o’|’-O’ options
   to move the result to a file.

   Similar to cURL, you can also
   use wget to download files.
   Refer to wget examples to
   understand how to use wget
   effectively.

3. Fetch Multiple Files at a time

   We can download multiple files
   in a single shot by specifying
   the URLs on the command line.
   Syntax:
$ curl -O URL1 -O URL2

   The below command will download
   both index.html and
   gettext.html and save it in the
   same name under the current
   directory.
$ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/ge
ttext/manual/html_node/index.html -O htt
p://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/
gettext.html

   Please note that when we
   download multiple files from a
   same sever as shown above, curl
   will try to re-use the
   connection.

4. Follow HTTP Location Headers with
-L option

   By default CURL doesn’t follow
   the HTTP Location headers. It
   is also termed as Redirects.
   When a requested web page is
   moved to another place, then an
   HTTP Location header will be
   sent as a Response and it will
   have where the actual web page
   is located.

   For example, when someone types
   google.com in the browser from
   India, it will be automatically
   redirected to ‘google.co.in’.
   This is done based on the HTTP
   Location header as shown below.
$ curl http://www.google.com

<TITLE>302 Moved</TITLE>
<H1>302 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.co.in/">here<
/A>

   The above output says that the
   requested document is moved to
   ‘http://www.google.co.in/’.

   We can insists curl to follow
   the redirection using -L
   option, as shown below. Now it
   will download the
   google.co.in’s html source
   code.
$ curl -L http://www.google.com

5. Continue/Resume a Previous
Download

   Using curl -C option, you can
   continue a download which was
   stopped already for some
   reason. This will be helpful
   when you download large files,
   and the download got
   interrupted.

   If we say ‘-C -‘, then curl
   will find from where to start
   resuming the download. We can
   also give an offset ‘-C
   <offset>’. The given offset
   bytes will be skipped from the
   beginning for the source file.

   Start a big download using
   curl, and press Ctrl-C to stop
   it in between the download.
$ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/ge
ttext/manual/gettext.html
##############             20.1%

   Note: -# is used to display a
   progress bar instead of a
   progress meter.

   Now the above download was
   stopped at 20.1%. Using “curl
   -C -“, we can continue the
   download from where it left off
   earlier. Now the download
   continues from 20.1%.
curl -C - -O http://www.gnu.org/software
/gettext/manual/gettext.html
###############            21.1%

6. Limit the Rate of Data Transfer

   You can limit the amount at
   which the data gets transferred
   using –limit-rate option. You
   can specify the maximum
   transfer rate as argument.
$ curl --limit-rate 1000B -O http://www.
gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.
html

   The above command is limiting
   the data transfer to 1000
   Bytes/second. curl may use
   higher transfer rate for short
   span of time. But on an
   average, it will come around to
   1000B/second.

   The following was the progress
   meter for the above command.
   You can see that the current
   speed is near to the 1000
   Bytes.
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average
 Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload
Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  1 1215k    1 13601    0     0    957
    0  0:21:40  0:00:14  0:21:26   999
  1 1215k    1 14601    0     0    960
    0  0:21:36  0:00:15  0:21:21   999
  1 1215k    1 15601    0     0    962
    0  0:21:34  0:00:16  0:21:18   999

7. Download a file only if it is
modified before/after the given time

   We can get the files that are
   modified after a particular
   time using -z option in curl.
   This will work for both FTP &
   HTTP.
$ curl -z 21-Dec-11 http://www.example.c
om/yy.html

   The above command will download
   the yy.html only if it is
   modified later than the given
   date and time
$ curl -z -21-Dec-11 http://www.example.
com/yy.html

   The above command will download
   the yy.html, if it is modified
   before than the given date and
   time.

   Please refer ‘man curl_getdate’
   for the various syntax
   supported for the date
   expression

8. Pass HTTP Authentication in cURL

   Sometime, websites will require
   a username and password to view
   the content ( can be done with
   .htaccess file ). With the help
   of -u option, we can pass those
   credentials from cURL to the
   web server as shown below.
$ curl -u username:password URL

   Note: By default curl uses
   Basic HTTP Authentication. We
   can specify other
   authentication method using
   –ntlm | –digest.

9. Download Files from FTP server

   cURL can also be used to
   download files from FTP
   servers. If the given FTP path
   is a directory, by default it
   will list the files under the
   specific directory.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_s
erver/public_html/xss.php

   The above command will download
   the xss.php file from the ftp
   server and save it in the local
   directory.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_s
erver/public_html/

   Here, the given URL refers to a
   directory. So cURL will list
   all the files and directories
   under the given URL

   If you are new to FTP/sFTP,
   refer ftp sftp tutorial for
   beginners.

10. List/Download using Ranges

   cURL supports ranges to be
   given in the URL. When a range
   is given, files matching within
   the range will be downloaded.
   It will be helpful to download
   packages from the FTP mirror
   sites.
$ curl   ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/
pool/main/[a-z]/

   The above command will list out
   all the packages from a-z
   ranges in the terminal.

11. Upload Files to FTP Server

   Curl can also be used to upload
   files to the FTP server with -T
   option.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T myfile.txt
ftp://ftp.testserver.com

   The above command will upload
   the file named myfile.txt to
   the FTP server. You can also
   upload multiple files at a same
   time using the range
   operations.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T "{file1,fil
e2}" ftp://ftp.testserver.com

   Optionally we can use “.” to
   get the input from STDIN and
   transfer to the remote.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T - ftp://ftp
.testserver.com/myfile_1.txt

   The above command will get the
   input from the user from
   Standard Input and save the
   contents in the ftp server
   under the name ‘myfile_1.txt’.

   You can provide one ‘-T’ for
   each URL and the pair specifies
   what to upload where.

12. More Information using Verbose
and Trace Option

   You can get to know what is
   happening using the -v option.
   -v option enable the verbose
   mode and it will print the
   details
curl -v http://google.co.in

   The about command will output
   the following
* About to connect() to www.google.co.in
 port 80 (#0)
*   Trying 74.125.236.56... connected
* Connected to www.google.co.in (74.125.

.
.

   If you need more detailed
   information then you can use
   the –trace option. The trace
   option will enable a full trace
   dump of all incoming/outgoing
   data to the given file
=> Send header, 169 bytes (0xa9)
0000: 47 45 54 20 2f 20 48 54 54 50 2f 3

0010: 0a

   This verbose and trace option
   will come in handy when curl
   fails due to some reason and we
   don’t know why.

13. Get Definition of a Word using
DICT Protocol

   You can use cURL to get the
   definition for a word with the
   help of DICT protocol. We need
   to pass a Dictionary Server URL
   to it.
$ curl dict://dict.org/d:bash

   The above command will list the
   meaning for bash as follows
151 "Bash" gcide "The Collaborative Inte
rnational Dictionary of English v.0.48"
Bash \Bash\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Bashed
}; p. pr. & vb. n.
   {Bashing}.] [Perh. of imitative origi
n; or cf. Dan. baske to
   strike, bask a blow, Sw. basa to beat
, bas a beating.]
   To strike heavily; to beat; to crush.
 [Prov. Eng. & Scot.]
   --Hall Caine.
   [1913 Webster]

         Bash her open with a rock.
          --Kipling.
   [Webster 1913 Suppl.]
.
151 "Bash" gcide "The Collaborative Inte
rnational Dictionary of English v.0.48"
Bash \Bash\, n.
   1. a forceful blow, especially one th
at does damage to its
      target.
      [PJC]
.
.

   Now you can see that it uses
   “The Collaborative
   International Dictionary of
   English”. There are many
   dictionaries are available. We
   can list all the dictionaries
   using
$ curl dict://dict.org/show:db

jargon "The Jargon File (version 4.4.7,
29 Dec 2003)"
foldoc "The Free On-line Dictionary of C
omputing (26 July 2010)"
easton "Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary"
hitchcock "Hitchcock's Bible Names Dicti
onary (late 1800's)"
bouvier "Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revis
ed 6th Ed (1856)"

   Now in-order to find the actual
   meaning of Bash in computer we
   can search for bash in “foldoc”
   dictionary as follows
$ curl dict://dict.org/d:bash:foldoc

   The result will be,
bash

   Bourne Again SHell.  {GNU}'s {command
 interpreter} for {Unix}.
   Bash is a {Posix}-compatible {shell}
with full {Bourne shell}
   syntax, and some {C shell} commands b
uilt in.  The Bourne
   Again Shell supports {Emacs}-style co
mmand-line editing, job
   control, functions, and on-line help.
  Written by Brian Fox of
   {UCSB}.

   For more details with regard to
   DICT please read RFC2229

14. Use Proxy to Download a File

   We can specify cURL to use
   proxy to do the specific
   operation using -x option. We
   need to specify the host and
   port of the proxy.
$ curl -x proxysever.test.com:3128 http:
//google.co.in

15. Send Mail using SMTP Protocol

   cURL can also be used to send
   mail using the SMTP protocol.
   You should specify the
   from-address, to-address, and
   the mailserver ip-address as
   shown below.
$ curl --mail-from blah@test.com --mail-
rcpt foo@test.com smtp://mailserver.com

   Once the above command is
   entered, it will wait for the
   user to provide the data to
   mail. Once you’ve composed your
   message, type . (period) as the
   last line, which will send the
   email immediately.

       Thank you for this article
       I was surprised that curl
       can send emails and upload
       files to ftp server.
       I will be looking now to
       use it in my scripts to
       upload files to SFTP server
       where password
       authentication is required.

       @Ashwini Kumar
       What is the exact command
       that you are trying to
       execute?
       curl –mail-from
       blah@test.com –mail-rcpt
       foo@test.com
       smtp://mailserver.com
       You need to replace the
       ‘mailserver.com’ with the
       actual mail server in your
       office/home.
       Same way mail-from and rcpt
       also need to be changed
       appropriately
       If your mail server IP is
       192.168.1.1 and we both are
       in same office then the
       following will work
       curl –mail-from
       lakshmanan@office.co.in
       –mail-rcpt
       aswini@office.co.in
       smtp://192.168.1.1

       @bells
       cURL comes in 2 form. Once
       is ‘curl’ command and
       another one is ‘libcurl’ (
       cURL library ). The
       curl_getdate is a function
       in that library. Ensure
       that you have installed
       libcurl package.

       Thank you for this article.
       I am using curl in my
       script to posting a text to
       our SMS gateway as below.
       curl
       “http:///send_sms.php?usern
       ame=&password=&phoneno=&tex
       t=”
       For the above, I extract
       and store the email body to
       a variable to send out
       messages. But the curl
       sends out only a first word
       in the variable, anything
       after space it ignores. If
       replace the spaces with +
       symbols, it works. Is it
       possible in curl itself to
       do this conversion
       (replacing space with +
       symbol).
       Please advise me on this.
       Regards
       Yunus

       WRT #11 above, is there a
       way to use a wildcard in
       order to FTP files using a
       script. The problem I have
       is the files I need to
       transfer have their names
       changed because part of the
       file name is the date. Data
       is recorded for 24 hours
       and at midnight a new file
       is created with the same
       name but with the day
       incremented by a day.
       (i.e. previous filename
       “file_12-12-2012.txt” and
       new filename
       “file_12-13-2012.txt” )
       As you know by using just
       FTP in UNIX, for example,
       it would be “mput
       file_12-*-2012.txt”
       Thanks,
       Dee

       Hi I am using the curl
       script to download the file
       from the URL. Below is the
       code I am using to do this.
       curl -o
       /u04/DATALOAD/VEGAS/IN/GAME
       S_27072013.csv
       “https://some-url”
       I am executing the above
       curl script in putty. I am
       getting the error as below
       curl: (52) SSL read:
       error:00000000:lib(0):func(
       0):reason(0), errno 104
       The same code is executing
       fine for the smaller file
       size. Even someties works
       good for the above command
       as well. But some time I
       get this error. Can anyone
       help me in this to get this
       up and running always
       without any failures. I am
       new to this any help on
       this is much appreciated.

       @Radhika
       To debug your problem:
       1) Try yours [curl]
       commands by hand. Try
       several web sites.
       2) if it works, try by hand
       the whole commands included
       in your [while] loop.
       3) if it works, try your
       [while] line, but add some
       [echo] commands to see what
       is going to be executed.
       That should do the trick!

       It is only with this web
       site I have an issue. I am
       able to get for the rest.
       As you suggested I shall
       try while loop. Thank you

       Great article.
       Do you know if there is any
       way to call the next page
       as defined in the header
       when a file is paginated?
       The url for rel=’next’ just
       has a page=2 on it, but
       when I execute this I get a
       401 authentication error
       even with the access_token
       added.
       The command I am issuing
       for the first page is curl
       -k
       https://XX.XXX.XXX/api/v1/a
       ccounts/1/users?access_toke
       n=XXXX
       The response to the curl
       -kI responds with Link: ;
       rel=”next”,

       Can you tell me what the
       syntax is for uploading a
       file with curl using SFTP
       server and creating a
       directory in the same
       command line?
       I tried it with
       –ftp-create-dirs and also
       with using the -o to define
       the new filename on the
       sftp server. I noticed that
       the syntax is very strict
       in use.

       I need some guidance
       regarding curl.
       I was transferring file
       through IPSEC ip address,
       file is transferring
       successfully.But during
       transferring the file, the
       IPSEC ip address re
       -established which leads to
       kill the curl command.
       I again re enter the same
       command with updated IPSEC
       ip address, but now file is
       not transferring. I am not
       seeing error message.
       Please help me out here.I
       am new to IPSEC & curl.
       Thanks in advance.
