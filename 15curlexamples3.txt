15 Practical Linux cURL Command Examples (cURL Download Examples)

   by Lakshmanan Ganapathy
   on April 11, 2012

   cURL is a software package which consists of command line tool and a library for transferring data using URL syntax.

   cURL supports various protocols like, DICT, FILE, FTP, FTPS, Gopher,
   HTTP, HTTPS, IMAP, IMAPS, LDAP, LDAPS, POP3, POP3S, RTMP, RTSP, SCP,
   SFTP, SMTP, SMTPS, Telnet and TFTP.

   This article provides 15 practical cURL usage examples.

1. Download a Single File

   The following command will get the content of the URL and display it in
   the STDOUT (i.e on your terminal).
$ curl http://www.centos.org

   To store the output in a file, you an redirect it as shown below. This
   will also display some additional download statistics.
$ curl http://www.centos.org > centos-org.html
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100 27329    0 27329    0     0   104k      0 --:--:-- --:--:-- --:--:--  167k

2. Save the cURL Output to a file

   We can save the result of the curl command to a file by using -o/-O
   options.
     * -o (lowercase o) the result will be saved in the filename provided
       in the command line
     * -O (uppercase O) the filename in the URL will be taken and it will
       be used as the filename to store the result

$ curl -o mygettext.html http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

   Now the page gettext.html will be saved in the file named
   ‘mygettext.html’. You can also note that when running curl with -o
   option, it displays the progress meter for the download as follows.

   [INS: :INS]

  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
 66 1215k   66  805k    0     0  33060      0  0:00:37  0:00:24  0:00:13 45900
100 1215k  100 1215k    0     0  39474      0  0:00:31  0:00:31 --:--:-- 68987

   When you use curl -O (uppercase O), it will save the content in the
   file named ‘gettext.html’ itself in the local machine.
$ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

   Note: When curl has to write the data to the terminal, it disables the
   Progress Meter, to avoid confusion in printing. We can use
   ‘>’|’-o’|’-O’ options to move the result to a file.

   Similar to cURL, you can also use wget to download files. Refer to
   [13]wget examples to understand how to use wget effectively.

3. Fetch Multiple Files at a time

   We can download multiple files in a single shot by specifying the URLs
   on the command line.
   Syntax:
$ curl -O URL1 -O URL2

   The below command will download both index.html and gettext.html and
   save it in the same name under the current directory.
$ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/html_node/index.html -O htt
p://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html

   Please note that when we download multiple files from a same sever as
   shown above, curl will try to re-use the connection.

4. Follow HTTP Location Headers with -L option

   By default CURL doesn’t follow the HTTP Location headers. It is also
   termed as Redirects. When a requested web page is moved to another
   place, then an HTTP Location header will be sent as a Response and it
   will have where the actual web page is located.

   For example, when someone types google.com in the browser from India,
   it will be automatically redirected to ‘google.co.in’. This is done
   based on the HTTP Location header as shown below.
$ curl http://www.google.com

<TITLE>302 Moved</TITLE>
<H1>302 Moved</H1>
The document has moved
<A HREF="http://www.google.co.in/">here</A>

   The above output says that the requested document is moved to
   ‘http://www.google.co.in/’.

   We can insists curl to follow the redirection using -L option, as shown
   below. Now it will download the google.co.in’s html source code.
$ curl -L http://www.google.com

5. Continue/Resume a Previous Download

   Using curl -C option, you can continue a download which was stopped
   already for some reason. This will be helpful when you download large
   files, and the download got interrupted.

   If we say ‘-C -‘, then curl will find from where to start resuming the
   download. We can also give an offset ‘-C <offset>’. The given offset
   bytes will be skipped from the beginning for the source file.

   Start a big download using curl, and press Ctrl-C to stop it in between
   the download.
$ curl -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
##############             20.1%

   Note: -# is used to display a progress bar instead of a progress meter.

   Now the above download was stopped at 20.1%. Using “curl -C -“, we can
   continue the download from where it left off earlier. Now the download
   continues from 20.1%.
curl -C - -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.html
###############            21.1%

6. Limit the Rate of Data Transfer

   You can limit the amount at which the data gets transferred using
   –limit-rate option. You can specify the maximum transfer rate as
   argument.
$ curl --limit-rate 1000B -O http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/manual/gettext.
html

   The above command is limiting the data transfer to 1000 Bytes/second.
   curl may use higher transfer rate for short span of time. But on an
   average, it will come around to 1000B/second.

   The following was the progress meter for the above command. You can see
   that the current speed is near to the 1000 Bytes.
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
  1 1215k    1 13601    0     0    957      0  0:21:40  0:00:14  0:21:26   999
  1 1215k    1 14601    0     0    960      0  0:21:36  0:00:15  0:21:21   999
  1 1215k    1 15601    0     0    962      0  0:21:34  0:00:16  0:21:18   999

7. Download a file only if it is modified before/after the given time

   We can get the files that are modified after a particular time using -z
   option in curl. This will work for both FTP & HTTP.
$ curl -z 21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html

   The above command will download the yy.html only if it is modified
   later than the given date and time
$ curl -z -21-Dec-11 http://www.example.com/yy.html

   The above command will download the yy.html, if it is modified before
   than the given date and time.

   Please refer ‘man curl_getdate’ for the various syntax supported for
   the date expression

8. Pass HTTP Authentication in cURL

   Sometime, websites will require a username and password to view the
   content ( can be done with .htaccess file ). With the help of -u
   option, we can pass those credentials from cURL to the web server as
   shown below.
$ curl -u username:password URL

   Note: By default curl uses Basic HTTP Authentication. We can specify
   other authentication method using –ntlm | –digest.

9. Download Files from FTP server

   cURL can also be used to download files from FTP servers. If the given
   FTP path is a directory, by default it will list the files under the
   specific directory.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/xss.php

   The above command will download the xss.php file from the ftp server
   and save it in the local directory.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -O ftp://ftp_server/public_html/

   Here, the given URL refers to a directory. So cURL will list all the
   files and directories under the given URL

   If you are new to FTP/sFTP, refer [14]ftp sftp tutorial for beginners.

10. List/Download using Ranges

   cURL supports ranges to be given in the URL. When a range is given,
   files matching within the range will be downloaded. It will be helpful
   to download packages from the FTP mirror sites.
$ curl   ftp://ftp.uk.debian.org/debian/pool/main/[a-z]/

   The above command will list out all the packages from a-z ranges in the
   terminal.

11. Upload Files to FTP Server

   Curl can also be used to upload files to the FTP server with -T option.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T myfile.txt ftp://ftp.testserver.com

   The above command will upload the file named myfile.txt to the FTP
   server. You can also upload multiple files at a same time using the
   range operations.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T "{file1,file2}" ftp://ftp.testserver.com

   Optionally we can use “.” to get the input from STDIN and transfer to
   the remote.
$ curl -u ftpuser:ftppass -T - ftp://ftp.testserver.com/myfile_1.txt

   The above command will get the input from the user from Standard Input
   and save the contents in the ftp server under the name ‘myfile_1.txt’.

   You can provide one ‘-T’ for each URL and the pair specifies what to
   upload where.

12. More Information using Verbose and Trace Option

   You can get to know what is happening using the -v option. -v option
   enable the verbose mode and it will print the details
curl -v http://google.co.in

   The about command will output the following
* About to connect() to www.google.co.in port 80 (#0)
*   Trying 74.125.236.56... connected
* Connected to www.google.co.in (74.125.236.56) port 80 (#0)
> GET / HTTP/1.1

.
.

   If you need more detailed information then you can use the –trace
   option. The trace option will enable a full trace dump of all
   incoming/outgoing data to the given file
=> Send header, 169 bytes (0xa9)
0000: 47 45 54 20 2f 20 48 54 54 50 2f 31 2e 31 0d 0a GET / HTTP/1.1..

0010: 0a

   This verbose and trace option will come in handy when curl fails due to
   some reason and we don’t know why.

13. Get Definition of a Word using DICT Protocol

   You can use cURL to get the definition for a word with the help of DICT
   protocol. We need to pass a Dictionary Server URL to it.
$ curl dict://dict.org/d:bash

   The above command will list the meaning for bash as follows
151 "Bash" gcide "The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48"
Bash \Bash\, v. t. [imp. & p. p. {Bashed}; p. pr. & vb. n.
   {Bashing}.] [Perh. of imitative origin; or cf. Dan. baske to
   strike, bask a blow, Sw. basa to beat, bas a beating.]
   To strike heavily; to beat; to crush. [Prov. Eng. & Scot.]
   --Hall Caine.
   [1913 Webster]

         Bash her open with a rock.               --Kipling.
   [Webster 1913 Suppl.]
.
151 "Bash" gcide "The Collaborative International Dictionary of English v.0.48"
Bash \Bash\, n.
   1. a forceful blow, especially one that does damage to its
      target.
      [PJC]
.
.

   Now you can see that it uses “The Collaborative International
   Dictionary of English”. There are many dictionaries are available. We
   can list all the dictionaries using
$ curl dict://dict.org/show:db

jargon "The Jargon File (version 4.4.7, 29 Dec 2003)"
foldoc "The Free On-line Dictionary of Computing (26 July 2010)"
easton "Easton's 1897 Bible Dictionary"
hitchcock "Hitchcock's Bible Names Dictionary (late 1800's)"
bouvier "Bouvier's Law Dictionary, Revised 6th Ed (1856)"

   Now in-order to find the actual meaning of Bash in computer we can
   search for bash in “foldoc” dictionary as follows
$ curl dict://dict.org/d:bash:foldoc

   The result will be,
bash

   Bourne Again SHell.  {GNU}'s {command interpreter} for {Unix}.
   Bash is a {Posix}-compatible {shell} with full {Bourne shell}
   syntax, and some {C shell} commands built in.  The Bourne
   Again Shell supports {Emacs}-style command-line editing, job
   control, functions, and on-line help.  Written by Brian Fox of
   {UCSB}.

   For more details with regard to DICT please read [15]RFC2229

14. Use Proxy to Download a File

   We can specify cURL to use proxy to do the specific operation using -x
   option. We need to specify the host and port of the proxy.
$ curl -x proxysever.test.com:3128 http://google.co.in

15. Send Mail using SMTP Protocol

   cURL can also be used to send mail using the SMTP protocol. You should
   specify the from-address, to-address, and the mailserver ip-address as
   shown below.
$ curl --mail-from blah@test.com --mail-rcpt foo@test.com smtp://mailserver.com

   Once the above command is entered, it will wait for the user to provide
   the data to mail. Once you’ve composed your message, type . (period) as
   the last line, which will send the email immediately.
Subject: Testing
This is a test mail

       @Ashwini Kumar
       What is the exact command that you are trying to execute?
       curl –mail-from [41]blah@test.com –mail-rcpt [42]foo@test.com
       smtp://mailserver.com
       You need to replace the ‘mailserver.com’ with the actual mail
       server in your office/home.
       Same way mail-from and rcpt also need to be changed appropriately
       If your mail server IP is 192.168.1.1 and we both are in same
       office then the following will work
       curl –mail-from [43]lakshmanan@office.co.in –mail-rcpt
       [44]aswini@office.co.in smtp://192.168.1.1

       @bells
       cURL comes in 2 form. Once is ‘curl’ command and another one is
       ‘libcurl’ ( cURL library ). The curl_getdate is a function in that
       library. Ensure that you have installed libcurl package.

       Thank you for this article.
       I am using curl in my script to posting a text to our SMS gateway
       as below.
       curl “http:///send_sms.php?username=&password=&phoneno=&text=”
       For the above, I extract and store the email body to a variable to
       send out messages. But the curl sends out only a first word in the
       variable, anything after space it ignores. If replace the spaces
       with + symbols, it works. Is it possible in curl itself to do this
       conversion (replacing space with + symbol).
       Please advise me on this.

       WRT #11 above, is there a way to use a wildcard in order to FTP
       files using a script. The problem I have is the files I need to
       transfer have their names changed because part of the file name is
       the date. Data is recorded for 24 hours and at midnight a new file
       is created with the same name but with the day incremented by a
       day.
       (i.e. previous filename “file_12-12-2012.txt” and new filename
       “file_12-13-2012.txt” )
       As you know by using just FTP in UNIX, for example, it would be
       “mput file_12-*-2012.txt”
       Thanks,

       @Radhika
       To debug your problem:
       1) Try yours [curl] commands by hand. Try several web sites.
       2) if it works, try by hand the whole commands included in your
       [while] loop.
       3) if it works, try your [while] line, but add some [echo] commands
       to see what is going to be executed.
       That should do the trick!

       @Philippe
       Thank you the suggestion. It is only with this web site I have an
       issue. I am able to get for the rest. As you suggested I shall try
       while loop. Thank you for your time.

       Great article.
       Do you know if there is any way to call the next page as defined in
       the header when a file is paginated? The url for rel=’next’ just
       has a page=2 on it, but when I execute this I get a 401
       authentication error even with the access_token added.
       The command I am issuing for the first page is curl -k
       [60]https://XX.XXX.XXX/api/v1/accounts/1/users?access_token=XXXX
       The response to the curl -kI responds with Link: ; rel=”next”,

       Can you tell me what the syntax is for uploading a file with curl
       using SFTP server and creating a directory in the same command
       line?
       I tried it with –ftp-create-dirs and also with using the -o to
       define the new filename on the sftp server. I noticed that the
       syntax is very strict in use.

       What will happen if I use a normal word instead of a url with -O in
       curl?
       e.g. what will happen if I type following command? :
       curl -O [68]http://url/test.txt -O original

       Great article.
       I need some guidance regarding curl.
       I was transferring file through IPSEC ip address, file is
       transferring successfully.But during transferring the file, the
       IPSEC ip address re -established which leads to kill the curl
       command.
       I again re enter the same command with updated IPSEC ip address,
       but now file is not transferring. I am not seeing error message.
       Please help me out here.I am new to IPSEC & curl.
       Thanks in advance.

       The ftp directory listing feature doesn’t seem to be available on
       OS X:
       $ curl -O [78]ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/pub/taxonomy/accession2taxid/
       curl: Remote file name has no length!
       curl: try ‘curl –help’ or ‘curl –manual’ for more information
